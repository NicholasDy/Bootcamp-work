    <p>
        My name is Nicholas Dyke and I living in Connecticut with my girlfriend Katie and our dog Ducky. Katie and I recently started hiking during Covid in an effort not to kill each other from being in our tiny apartment together. 
        Thats what you are seeing in the above picture. In the constant effort us to improve ourselfs Katie has enrolled in a masters program while I started coding. 
        We are excited where the next part of our lives end up together and how we are going to move forward together.
